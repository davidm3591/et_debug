Documentation Update/Build Notes


1. Add #video tags to all video follow on frames. (All non #Anchor and non #Frame video slides still require the #video tag.)

2. No Audio: NA - for task frame without audio (entry, hint, exit).

3. Times need to be correct format (decimal minutes 0.5 min/minutes), examples:

Timing ≈ 0.5 min
Timing ≈ 0.5 minute
Timing ≈ 0.5 minutes


4. All information slides (graphics, etc.) need to go to front of the pptx slides with the rest of the information slides, not at the end of the presentation.

5. The vocab words need to be separated by an en dash (Unicode hex: 2013) and preceded by the the phrase "Words and Definitions:" on its own line. Example

Words and Definitions:

one – is the lonliest number
two – is just as bad as one, it's the lonliest
three – ah heck, just leave it alone
