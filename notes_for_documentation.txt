Documentation Update/Build Notes


1. All non #Anchor and non #Frame video slides still require the #video tag

2. Times need to be correct format (decimal minutes 0.5 min/minutes), examples:

```
Timing ≈ 0.5

Timing ≈ 0.5 min

Timing ≈ 0.5 minute

Timing ≈ 0.5 minutes

```

3. All information slides (graphics, etc.) need to go to front of the pptx slides with the rest of the information slides, not at the end of the presentation.

4. The vocab words need to be separated by an en dash (Unicode hex: 2013) and preceded by the the phrase "Words and Definitions:" on its own line. Example

```
Words and Definitions:

one – is the lonliest number
two – is just as bad as one, it's the lonliest
three – a heck, just leave it alone
```
