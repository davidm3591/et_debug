Notes Slide Placeholders

What we haven’t explicitly seen so far is the shapes on a slide master. It’s easy to get started with that:

>>> notes_placeholder = notes_slide.notes_placeholder

This notes placeholder is just like a body placeholder we saw a couple sections back. You can change its position, size, and many other attributes, as well as get at its text via its text frame.

You can also access the other placeholders:

>>> for placeholder in notes_slide.placeholders:
...   print placeholder.placeholder_format.type
...
SLIDE_IMAGE (101)
BODY (2)
SLIDE_NUMBER (13)

and also the shapes (a superset of the placeholders):

>>> for shape in notes_slide.shapes:
...   print shape
...
<pptx.shapes.placeholder.NotesSlidePlaceholder object at 0x11091e890>
<pptx.shapes.placeholder.NotesSlidePlaceholder object at 0x11091e750>
<pptx.shapes.placeholder.NotesSlidePlaceholder object at 0x11091e990>

In the common case, the notes slide contains only placeholders. However, if you added an image, for example, to the notes slide, that would show up as well. Note that if you added that image to the notes master, perhaps a logo, it would appear on the notes slide “visually”, but would not appear as a shape in the notes slide shape collection. Rather, it is visually “inherited” from the notes master.
