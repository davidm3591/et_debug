Official Shapes (Six-and only six-official PPT shapes)

1. auto shape: regular shape (rectangle, ellipse, triangle, block arrows), takes fill, outline, and text
   (auto shapes can also have an image as fill)
   (text box is also an auto shape, just without default fill and/or outline)

2. picture: raster images (photo, clip art) are referred to as a picture in PowerPoint.

3. graphic frame: name PPT uses for a table, graph, smart art, or media. graphic frames cannot be
   created directly, they are automatically created when one of the objects mentioned are added to a slide

4. group shape: created by grouping a set of shapes - can't actually see this except by bounding box in slide

5. line/connector: different from auto shapes because they are linear (not supported by python-pptx)

6. content part: something to do with embedding "foreign" XML like SVG in a presentation (not supported
   by python-pptx)
